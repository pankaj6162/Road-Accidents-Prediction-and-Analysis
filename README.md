# Road Accident Predictions and Analysis

**May 2024**

## Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the severity of road accidents based on various factors. The model classifies accidents into three categories: Fatal, Serious, and Slight.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JS**: For creating the front-end user interface.
- **Python**: For backend development and machine learning.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computing.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
  - **Flask**: For building the web application and API.
- **Google Collab**: For developing and running machine learning models in an interactive environment.

## Project Details

### Data Analysis
- Conducted comprehensive and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset comprising 1.48 million records.
- Used data visualization tools to identify patterns and correlations in the data.

### Machine Learning Model
- **Implemented Algorithms**:
  - **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for binary classification.
  - **Decision Tree**: A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions.
  - **RandomForest**: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.
- **Model Performance**:
  - Achieved the highest accuracy of 93.09% with the RandomForest algorithm.
  - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-Score, and recall.

### SMS Alert System
- **Twilio API**: Integrated to send real-time SMS alerts to police with accident severity and location.

## Usage
